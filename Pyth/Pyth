a. How can you declare variables of different data types in Python? Create examples for
string, integer, float, list, tuple, set, and dictionary. Then, find out and print their types

Assigning values to variables in Python is a fundamental concept. It allows you to store and manipulate data within your code.
To assign a value to a variable, you can use the assignment operator “=”.
The name of the variable is the operand to the left of the = operator, and the value stored in the variable is the operand to the right of the = operator.

number = 100          # An integer assignment
score   = 98.5          # A floating point
name    = "Prince"          # A String
fooditem = [yam, rice, beans] # A List
colour = (red, black, green) # A Tuple
games = {cycling, soccer, swimming} # A Set
numbers = {1: “a”, 2: “b”, 3: “c”, 4: “d”, 5: “e”} # A Dictionary

b.Given the string "Python Mentorship Program", can you reverse its characters, change it to
uppercase, and substitute "Python" with another word of your choice? Show how.

# Reverse the string "Python Mentorship Program"
typ = "Python Mentorship Program"[::-1]
print(txyp)

#Uppercase
filex = "Python Mentorship Program"

y = filex.upper()

print(y)

#Substitute
txt = "Python Mentorship Program"

x = txt.replace("Python", "Christian")

print(x)

c. With the initial list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], how would you append an element, remove an element,
and extend it with another list [7, 8, 9]?

a_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for i in range(7, 8, 9):
    a_list.append(i)

fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

fruits.remove("banana")

d.If you have a tuple (10, 20, 30), how can you unpack its values into separate variables?

number = (10, 20, 30)

(even, even, odd) = number

e. Given two sets {1, 2, 3, 4} and {3, 4, 5, 6}, how would you perform and display the results
of their union, intersection, and difference operations?

x = {1, 2, 3, 4}
y = {3, 4, 5, 6}

Union : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Intersection : [4]
Difference : [1, 2, 3, 5, 6]


f. How can you manipulate a dictionary {'name': 'John', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'} to add,
update, and remove key-value pairs? Illustrate this by adding 'occupation': 'Engineer',
changing 'age' to 26, and removing the key 'city'.














g.What are the ways to convert the string "123" into an integer and the list [1, 2, 3] into a
set? Demonstrate your approach.

#CONVERTING STRING INTO AN INTEGER

# Initialising a string
string = "123"

# Show the Data type
print(type(string))

# Converting string into int
string_to_int = int(string)

# Show the Data type
print(type(string_to_int))


h. With variables x = 5 and y = 10, how can you execute and display the results of basic
arithmetic operations and exponentiation between them?
